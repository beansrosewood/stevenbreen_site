Steven Breen Industrial Service(collectively, “SPB”) have created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices relating to SPB’s website (“Site”), mobile applications, the delivery of our services, and other interactions with you. Please note that when you access any external links from SPB’s Site (including any SPB’s affiliate Sites), such external websites may have different privacy policies from the Site and SPB is not responsible for the privacy practices of such external websites. We encourage you to read all privacy policies posted on the web sites that you visit.

1. Personal Information Collection
SPB may collect personal information which is information that alone or in combination with other information could be used to identify you. This could include your name, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, and home or business and mailing address or other location from which you use our services from information you provide us through technology including when you access certain areas of the SPB Site that require registration for certain services, or if you require more information about those services. If you decide to purchase our products or services, we and/or our third-party services providers may need to collect certain additional information, like your credit or debit card number and expiration date, bank routing and account number. We also collect photos and videos from cameras on our trucks to analyze the use and delivery of our services (i.e., to determine whether containers have been overfilled).



Device Information. When you are connected to our services via mobile applications (apps), we may collect device-specific information such as your device model, operating system, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information. We may associate your unique device identifier or phone number with information that you may have used to register for certain services or purchase products. Server logs that are maintained by us or by our third-party service providers may contain information about the services that you have used, and your device-specific information. We may also maintain digital communication logs that track information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information. We may use your device’s IP address or MAC address to track device-event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.



When you visit, use and interact with the Site, we may receive certain information about your visit, use or interactions. For example, we may monitor the number of people that visit the Site, peak hours of visits, which page(s) are visited, the domains our visitors come from (e.g., google.com, yahoo.com, etc.), and which browsers people use to access the Service (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, etc.), broad geographical information, and navigation pattern. In particular, the following information is created and automatically logged in our systems:

Specialized Information. We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches. Certain services may include a unique application number in connection with the installation of apps. This number and information, including, without limitation, operating system type and app version number may be sent to our service providers when you install, update or uninstall apps.
